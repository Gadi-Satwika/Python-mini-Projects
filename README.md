# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python mini-projects! Each project focuses on core programming logic, user interaction, and creativity. This repository showcases my learning and application of Python through fun, interactive, and console-based applications.

## 📁 Project List
### 🔢 3. Guess the Number Game (`guess_number_game.py`)
A number-guessing game where the user must guess the randomly generated number within limited attempts.

- Includes hints for high/low guesses
- Random number generation using Python's `random` module
- While loop + conditional logic practice

### 😄 2. Emoji Translator (`emji_translator.py`)
A simple emoji translator that converts words or phrases into fun emojis.

- Translates predefined keywords to emojis
- Helps understand dictionary usage and string manipulation
- Great for fun and experimenting with Unicode
- 
### 🎯 1. Minesweeper Game (`minesweeper.py`)
A console version of the classic Minesweeper game! Players select cells to reveal while avoiding hidden mines.

- Displays minefield with * values
- Uses Python logic to determine safe zones
- Command-line input-based interaction


### 👻 4. Hangman (`hangman.py`)
A classic word-guessing game where the user tries to guess a hidden word before they run out of attempts.

- Tracks correct and incorrect guesses
- Shows letter placeholders and partial reveals
- Ideal for practicing loops, lists, and string logic

### ✊✋✌️ 5. Rock Paper Scissors with Emojis (`rock_paper_scissor.py`)
A fun version of Rock-Paper-Scissors game using emojis to represent moves.

- Player vs Computer
- Uses `random.choice()` and conditional logic
- Adds a visual and playful twist with emoji icons
